# DAA_DataSortingAssignment
We were given a dataset that contained 111108 Entries and rows of data

We were assigned to do the following:
Consider the dataset that has been provided to you. You're expected to carry  out the following tasks and produce the corresponding outcomes by applying the  Insertion Sort and Merge Sort Algorithms. 
1. Take all numeric attributes from the dataset.  
2. If any attribute has a missing value, fill it using the median value. 
3. Use Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms. 
4. Sort the data into nonincreasing and nondecreasing order. 
5. Fill out the table by mentioning the computational time (processor  time) after getting results. 
6. Plot the running time using bar graphs.

# Important Note on how to make it work
The Code for Every Sort 
1- Merge Sort Ascending
2- Merge Sort Descending
3- Insertion Sort Ascending 
4- Insertion Sort Descending

I have made a folder for Each Column:
each column has All of the above-given Sort.

Run the Code and it will tell u the execution time.

# Important Requirment
Python 3.12
*Libraries*
pandas
openpyxl
time
